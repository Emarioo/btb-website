# Website structure

```
/home/user/website/BetterThanBatch
/home/user/website/btb-website
```

The website consist of 2 repositories and 3 things.
1. The website repo with the html and web server
2. The btb repo with the documentation (either from dev or the latest release)
3. A auto-update server to detect new pushes to website and btb repo to automatically git pull changes (Auto deployment)


We might add in more sub websites like morsecode which is also auto git pulled and deployed.
